# PsyZ

I'm including this mostly for posterity's sake (and partly because it amuses me): one
of the first things I wrote and made public.

It took its name in part from [Zenses](https://github.com/sixones/zenses), a tool for
*"scrobbling"* played tracks to [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) (the name being a
portmantea of "PsypherPunk" and "Zenses"â€”original, no?). This was an attempt to
achieve the same thing using Perl.
